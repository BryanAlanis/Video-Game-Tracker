# **Video Game Tracker**
_*Work in progress_

Inspired by Letterboxd, I wanted to build a personal project using Flutter that would serve a similar purpose as Letterboxd but for video games instead of movies. 
In short, a user can like, rate, mark a game as played or play later, and add a game to a list. The user can also create and manage their account.
This code builds the UI for a mobile application using Flutter and Flutter Bloc for state management.

### **Disclaimer**
This code only sets up the UI for the mobile application. It doesn't handle backend operations such as retrieving game information from an API or handling user information/authentication.
The code would need to be modified to work with your database. Either through a local SQL database or through a NoSQL database like Firebase, which is what I used.
